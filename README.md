# Deploying Reliable Software
A CSCD94 - Computer Science Project with Professor [Thierry Sans](https://github.com/thierrysans).

## Introduction
[Our website](https://deployingreliable.software)

An extension to the existing “Programming on the Web” course at the University of Toronto Scarborough. This research project aims to follow the two books by Google, Site Reliability Engineering and Site Reliability Workbook. There are two main objectives:
- What is the Google way of deploying software used by millions of people?
- How to maintain high availability while allowing for frequent software updates?

## Development Setup
Prerequisites: Docker and Docker Compose installed in your system.

1. To start all servers in development mode, simply run
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
