# Deploying Reliable Software
A CSCD94 - Computer Science Project with Professor [Thierry Sans](https://github.com/thierrysans).

## Introduction
An extension to the existing “Programming on the Web” course at the University of Toronto Scarborough. This research project aims to follow the two books by Google, Software Reliability Engineering and Software Reliability Workbook. There are two main objectives:
- What is the Google way of deploying software used by millions of people?
- How to maintain high availability while allowing for frequent software updates?
